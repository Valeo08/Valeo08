<h2 align="center">About me üòÅ</h2>

<p>My name is Jes√∫s Valeo. I've always liked computers, that's why since I was young 
  I learned to program with Java and some web languages. As soon as I could, I started 
  my degree in computer engineering, where I specialised in computer science. Since then 
  I have carried out many personal and academic projects focused on software development 
  or artificial intelligence, among others; although I have also worked with web technologies, 
  and video game programming.</p>
